# fashiondata-eslint-config

#### An ESLint [Shareable Config](http://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/shareable-configs)


## Install

```bash
yarn add git+https://github.com/FashionData/fashiondata-eslint-config
```

## Usage

Shareable configs are designed to work with the `extends` feature of `.eslintrc` files.
You can learn more about
[Shareable Configs](http://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/shareable-configs) on the
official ESLint website.

Add this to your `.eslintrc` file:

```
{
  "extends": "standard"
}
```

You can override settings from the shareable config by adding them directly into your
`.eslintrc` file.
